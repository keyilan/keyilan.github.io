I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Comparative Linguistics at the University of Zürich, as well as an honorary in the [Department of Languages & Linguistics](https://www.latrobe.edu.au/languages-and-linguistics) at La Trobe University and affiliated with La Trobe's Centre for Research on Language Diversity. My work is primarily on Sinitic and under-documented Tibeto-Burman varieties — primarily central Sal varities included under Tansa & Nocte — with a focus on historical phonology and tonology.

My PhD, titled [_The tone system of Tangsa-Nocte and related northern Naga varieties_](http://arrow.latrobe.edu.au:8080/vital/access/manager/Repository/latrobe:43159), was done under the direction of my advisor, [Dr. Stephen Morey](https://scholars.latrobe.edu.au/display/smorey) and co-advisor Dr. Marija Tabain.

I completed my masters thesis — _A Preliminary Description of the Historical Development of Modern Northern Wú Dialects_ (現代呉語太湖片發展的初步分析) — at the [Institute of Linguistics at National Tsing Hua University](http://www.ling.nthu.edu.tw/bin/home.php) (國立清華大學) under [Dr. Chang Kuang-yu](http://ling.web.nthu.edu.tw/files/14-1264-125505,r6426-1.php?Lang=zh-tw) (張光宇)

Additionally, I developed and currently manage [Phonemica](http://phonemica.net) (乡音苑), a crowd-sourced platform for oral history preservation and documentation of minority language varieties in and around China.

This site serves to consolidate publications, digital projects and information about relevant academic activities I've been involved with, mostly because I hate having to dig around for all that. Personal sites like [John Ohala's](http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~ohala/) are a blessing.
