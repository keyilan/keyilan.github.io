This introductory contribution to the inaugural issue of Languages and Peoples of the Eastern Himalayan Region (LPEHR) outlines the mission and goals of this new publication outlet. LPEHR takes over where the North East Indian Linguistics (NEIL) series left off. As such, this introduction also looks back on NEIL. An index of all articles published in the NEIL volumes is attached as supplemental material to this contribution.
