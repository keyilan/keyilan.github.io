title: "Written Standardization as a Precursor to Diglossia: A Case Study of  Wu"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-lacus
excerpt: 'This paper introduces the lack of a written standard for the Wu dialects as the primary limiting factor in creating a standardised form of the language. Examples are given of past attempts starting with missionary efforts in the late 1800s all the way up to modern re-appropriations of existing graphemes.'
