"The last article titled “Mapping the frontier: Correlating representations of Tangsa-Nocte villages in early British survey maps with modern GIS data” by Kellen Parker van Dam, is an attempt to study the old British records on the inhabitants in the Upper Patkai region who are categorized as Naga but are known in Arunachal Pradesh by different names like Tangsa, Nocte etc. The researcher’s purpose is to revisit the old mapping with the modern GIS data system so as to provide a more credible picture while at the same time reassert the identity, history and place of these communities." — from the preface
