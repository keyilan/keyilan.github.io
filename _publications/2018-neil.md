excerpt: 'This paper introduces the lack of a written standard for the Wu dialects as the primary limiting factor in creating a standardised form of the language. Examples are given of past attempts starting with missionary efforts in the late 1800s all the way up to modern re-appropriations of existing graphemes.'
