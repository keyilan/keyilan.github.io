title: "An Answer to Y.R. Chao's Problem of Affricate Distributions in WÃº"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-lacus
excerpt: 'This paper provides a solution to an apparent lack of discernable pattern for voiced fricative and affricate onsets within a specific class of words. It shows the current distribution to be the result of two competing sound shifts between affrication on the one hand and deaffrication on the other, providing a model for the lexical diffusion of the feature based in an historical context of human migration starting from the fall of the Northern Song.'
